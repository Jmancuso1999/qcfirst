<!--
You and your partner should commit and push your visual designs to your GitHub repository (qcfirst). You should then create a README (instructions below) including your visual designs and any other information you want to include about your site (features, contributors, purpose of the website, etc).

## Login Page

## Forgot User/Password Page
<!--
Note: For mobile version, there is 2 screen states for the forgot username/password BUT they are on the same page, the user would just scroll down to find fill the forgot password information out. 
-->

## New User Page

## Student Home Page 
<!---
Show img of BOTH screens (before and after) clicking drop courses -> explain how it switches screen.
-->
<p> When a student clicks the drop course button, a checklick pops up which allows a user to select which courses they would like to drop. The courses they would like to drop, they would have to confirm this by reclicking the drop courses button.</p>

<p>For the mobile version, the user has the same functionality, however, a problem we've considered is there may not be enough text space to display a students full course, so what we can is shorten the class name to display just the section and class number. (Consideration: Make it so a user can click on the class and it extends the schedule to display the rest of the information about the course).</p>


# After you make the README, it should be visible by going to your repo. Comment the link to your repo on this assignmentâ€™s page on Google Classroom. I will only grade your README.md document for this assignment, so it should include everything you create for this deliverable.

## Instructor Home Page


## Student Enrollment Page

-->

<p>When a user wants to obtain more information about a class, they click the box that contains the class they are interested in and it'll extend to show the rest of the information about the course.</p>
