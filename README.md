## Login Page

![tabletLogin](./images/tablet/login.png)
![desktopLogin](./images/desktop/login.png)

<p>Features: When a user logins, it redirects them to the home page. When a user forgets their password/username, it redirects them to the forgot password/username page. When a user wants to signup, it redirects them to the New Uer page.</p>

![tabletForgotUserPass](./images/tablet/forgot_user_password.png)
![desktopForgotUserPass](./images/desktop/forgot_user_pass.png)

<p>Features: </p>

<p>Note: For mobile version, there is 2 screen states for the forgot username/password BUT they are on the same page, the user would just scroll down to find fill the forgot password information out. </p>

## New User Page

![desktopNew](./images/desktop/new_user.png)

<p></p>



## Student Home Page

![tabletHome](./images/tablet/student_home1.png)
![tabletHomeDrop](./images/tablet/student_home2.png)
![desktopHome](./images/desktop/student_home.png)
![desktopHomeDrop](./images/desktop/student_home_drop.png)

<p> When a student clicks the drop course button, a checklick pops up which allows a user to select which courses they would like to drop. The courses they would like to drop, they would have to confirm this by reclicking the drop courses button.</p>

<p>For the mobile version, the user has the same functionality, however, a problem we've considered is there may not be enough text space to display a students full course, so what we can is shorten the class name to display just the section and class number. (Consideration: Make it so a user can click on the class and it extends the schedule to display the rest of the information about the course).</p>




## Instructor Home Page


<p></p>



## Student Enrollment Page


<p>When a user wants to obtain more information about a class, they click the box that contains the class they are interested in and it'll extend to show the rest of the information about the course.</p>

<p>Note: When a class is full, the add button is removed so a student wouldn't have the oppourunity to join the class.</p>

<p>For Mobile Version: Unlike the desktop and tablet version, the user will have the chance to show/hide filter. TO renenable or hide the filter, the user would click the filter button. Also, the mobile will have the chance to "apply" the filter by clicking a button which will hide the filter and then display the screen of courses.</p>


## Instructor Management Page


<p>Note: Margins for page will larger, we just wanted to show all the information that an instructor can provide when creating a course.</p>
